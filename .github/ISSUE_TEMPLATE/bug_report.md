## Describe the bug
A clear and concise description of what the bug is and preferably a step-by-step guide on how to reproduce it.

## Log file
Please generate a logfile by checking `'Output logfile'` in the exporter and attach it to the issue.

## Blend File (*optiona*l)
**Beware that anything attached to the issue can be seen/downloaded by anyone!!!**

A .zip containing a .blend file along with any resources referred to in the .blend file, except for stuff from the $data of Farming Simulator.

In case you want your stuff to stay private you should make a minimal example, that still causes the bug and attach that instead.
