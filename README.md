## Access

As it is under the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, and Giants have yet to commit to
"Officially" update the add-on.

I have posted it here for anyone that either wants to assist, and also for any community collaberation.

Deveolpement Access is not Guaranteed, you must have "some" experiance at using  the following -

1. Github proceedures
2. Knowledge of Python 3.6+
3. Knowledge of Blender 2.8
4. Keeping up to date as resonable to be aware of changes of the above for both current and future developement.

I am also an Interstate Truck driver and on the road frequently (usually five or six days a week).
If you decide to apply, you are free too, but do not expect to get access immediately (as in right now).
