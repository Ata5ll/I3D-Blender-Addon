## Description
I3d Addon for Blender 2.8.

## Suitability
This is **IN DEVELOPMENT** in no way shape or form is this currently working. 
(line added for **IDIOTS**).

## Purpose

A.The Main Objective is updating the Original Plugin written by GIANTS Software GmbH, to comply with Blender 2.8. 

B. This Updated addon is not intended to be backwards compatible with any previous versions of Blender.

## Objectives
1. To update code to be compliant for python 3.7+.
2. Improve where required to standards as outlined by Blender.org for any addons.
3. Any added functionality (if requested or possible) by the contrubuting community.

## Access
As it is under the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, and Giants have yet to commit to
"Officially" update the add-on.
I have posted it here for anyone that either wants to assist, and also for any community collaberation. 
Access is not Guaranteed as I am new at using github so there may be some limitations that i am not aware of.
